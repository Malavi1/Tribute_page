                <h1>Chiranjeevi Tirunagari</h1>
                <p>Chiranjeevi is a Product Engineer whose specialty lies in not giving up 🎯

                    Despite being unfamiliar with our tech stack, it took him all of 2 days to teach himself the nitty-gritty of it and crack our hiring assignment!
                    
                    A self-starter with a can-do attitude, Chiranjeevi has since then gone on to take up challenging projects at OSlash and perform splendidly at them 🥇
                    
                    When he’s not making the impossible possible, he likes to indulge in some cricket or swimming, and read up on health and fitness 🏏
                    
                    His message to those on a career-path like his own?
                    
                    “Dream big and have faith in your own abilities. Don’t settle for anything less than what you deserve.”</p>
